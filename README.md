#Edwin OAK - Eusocial Co-worker Robot

The purpose of the Edwin project is to explore human-robot interaction while both the robot and the human operator are aiming to achieve a common goal. To do so, we largely explore the area of non-verbal communication. This project began in Fall 2015.

This repository is the second version of the original code, located [here](https://github.com/olinrobotics/edwin).
